This project was done in order to provide Consultation for a company LogisticAI, and their business challenges. I was to understand the Technology Architecture & Key document to gain an understanding of the client’s technology architecture.

The fist task i was to do was ensure that i understood the Technology Architecture Measurements dataset contains information about client interactions with various components of the system.
 
I then calculated a new column that represents the percentage of the interaction duration that resulted in downtime.

Then i used the dataset and decided on a method to rank the components based on how “risky” they are.

Although it was down to me to decide how “risky” something is. 

Out of all the components that carry risk, you should prioritise the top 3 that you believe are most important for the client.
